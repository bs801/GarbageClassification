# GarbageClassification
This is a research project of three contributors, which is supervised by Noah Gift.

Our goal is to deploy the most accurate models out of three methods to Android device, which are traditional CNN, ResNet50 from tranfer learning, and Auto ML.

All the files with ipynb are the coding part of the project where we design, optimize our models. 
Auto ML model is trained using only 400 images dataset on Google Cloud Platform due to its capacity whereas CNN and ResNet50 is trained with 600 images.
Only Auto ML is deployed to Android device because its accuracy is the best out of three. The android deployment code is too big to be able to upload it here. 
If you would like to see it, you can email me and I will share with you on google drive. Here is my email chinasongbohan@hotmail.com.

The video is the final result testing of our project.

Thank You!!!
